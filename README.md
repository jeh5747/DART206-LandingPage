Your Project
------------

### ← README.md

That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

### ← index.html

Where you'll write the *content* of your website. 

### ← style.css

CSS files add *visual styling rules* to your content. Note that this file is within a folder called "css" to give you some practice working with file paths. This is also common practice for bigger proejcts where you might have multipel CSS files. 

### ← assets

Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project


The Grid Layout
------------
This template creates a simple one page website based on a 12 column grid. 
The grid is created with the CSS property `display: grid` which won't work in really old browsers, so make sure you're not using Interent Explorer.

All the `<section>` elements will be arranged into a grid automatically. Give each section a unique `class` and then set how many columns it should occupy in `styles.css` with `grid-column: span 4` \(which will span 4 columns out of 12\).

Both the HTML and CSS files included extensive comments \(displayed in gray\) to help you figure out what each line of code does. Try changing lots of things to see what happens in the actual website.
